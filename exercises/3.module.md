### Exercise 3 ###

> Tip:
> $ node filereader.js [path/to/filename]

1. Write a _filereader.js_ script that reads one file and print:
    ```javascript
    Success reading file "/path/to/filename"
    ```
1. Refactor previous script to the _"promissified"_ version.
1. Make it accept more files _(separated by comma)_ and handle error printing messages as bellow. Obs: reading multiple files doesn't need to be sequential.
    ```javascript
    $ node filereader.js file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt
    Success reading files: file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt
    //
    $ node filereader.js file1.txt,file2.txt,missing.txt
    Fail reading file missing.txt
    ```
